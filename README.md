# interpreter for functions of real variable and sets
## Syntax:

 Use **test1, test2 or test3** as an example how it works. 
 
 **Set rules:**   
 
 As an example we can define set with name A and elements 1,2 and 3 with: A= {1, 2, 3};
 
 When set is defined we can write it on output with print command : print A;
 
 Interpreter supports operations with sets as: union (A\/B), intersection (A/\B), complement(~A) and difference (A\B).
 Before using of complement opperation we need to define universal set (~A := UniversalSet\A).
 
 **Function rules:**
 
  As an example we can define function  with name f as function f=sin(x)*cos(x);
  
  When function is defined we can write it on output with print command : print f;
  
  When declaring a function we can use constans (real numbers), symbol x, sin symbol, cos symbol, and symbols like + ,- ,* ,( ,).
  
  
  We can change the value of the declared variable with command like: setName= newValue;  or function functionName= newWalue;
  
  Each command is need to be terminated with symbol ;.
  
  
 ## Guide:
  
  After downloading files you need to type make in terminal and execute ./interpreter.
  
  As well, you can try with: ./interpreter<test1/2/3.
