# This program is a interpreter for functions of real variable and sets
-Syntax:
 Use**test1, test2 or test3** as a example how it works. 
 As a example we can define set with name A and elements 1,2 and 3 with: A={1,2,3};
 When set is defined we can write it on output with print command : print A;
 Interpreter supports operations with sets as: union (A\/B), intersection (A/\B), complement(~A) and difference (A\B).
